## Overview

Agri trade in India has long been challenged by disconnected markets, price opacity, and unreliable leads. At **OBAOL**, we built a complete solution suite that empowers both **farmers and exporters** — helping producers get fair access to markets and helping buyers find traceable, quality-controlled commodities without the risk.

Our platform and network are designed to **digitally transform agri trade**, ensuring transparency, real-time visibility, and verified connections across the supply chain.

## Key Solutions Offered

- **Daily Verified Product Listings**: Farmers and FPOs list their products (like turmeric, cardamom, and rice) directly into our platform, visible to verified global buyers.
- **Trade Rooms & Buyer Discovery**: Exporters join curated community rooms (via GAIN) to match with live buyer requirements.
- **Live Market Pricing**: Both parties get access to real-time, trustworthy market prices based on region and commodity.
- **Lead Verification Engine**: Each trade inquiry is screened for intent, volume capacity, and past trade history before sharing.
- **Digital Trade Profiles**: Producers and exporters build reputation via successful trades, certifications, and reviews.

## Impact Highlights

- 👩‍🌾 Onboarded 500+ **farmers and producer groups** from India’s key agro clusters
- 🌐 Enabled **real exports** for first-time exporters in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Telangana
- 💸 Helped farmers secure **12–18% better rates** by skipping commission-heavy intermediaries
- 🔒 Reduced lead fraud by 80% with in-platform trade verification and support

## Tools & Technology Behind It

- **OBAOL Trade Platform**: A mobile-ready interface for listing products, managing inquiries, and building trust.
- **GAIN Community Access**: Invite-only, interest-based trade groups that foster genuine collaboration.
- **Live Support & Escrow**: Optional escrow and trade dispute mediation services for peace of mind.
