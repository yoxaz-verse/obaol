## Overview

To solve one of the most critical problems in B2B agro trade — _trust_ — OBAOL launched an ambitious initiative to build India's largest **Verified Supplier Network**. By onboarding genuine farmers, FPOs, traders, and processors, and validating them through a rigorous vetting process, we’ve established a high-trust ecosystem for agro exports.

Today, this network is the foundation of our **transparent trading model**, connecting global buyers with authentic Indian suppliers across spices, pulses, and grains.

## Key Milestones

- **Verified 1000+ Agro Suppliers**: Across turmeric, cardamom, cumin, rice, and more — each vetted through KYC, trade history, and farm-level checks.
- **PAN India Coverage**: Active supplier presence in key agro belts: Erode, Nizamabad, Wayanad, Unjha, Jalgaon, and East Godavari.
- **Digital Supplier IDs**: Each supplier is issued a unique digital identity for traceability and fraud protection.
- **Trade Matchmaking Engine**: Buyers are automatically connected to verified suppliers based on product specs, location, and logistics feasibility.
- **No Fake Leads Policy**: Every supplier is part of a closed, trusted GAIN (Global Agro Industry Network) group with zero tolerance for false listings.

## Technologies & Tools Used

- **OBAOL Supplier CRM**: A custom-built backend to onboard, review, and manage verified supplier profiles.
- **KYC Automation**: Integrated Aadhaar/PAN verification and geo-tagged farm location capture.
- **Trust Badges & Reputation Scores**: Built-in metrics to track supplier reliability, trade volume, and delivery performance.

## Impact

- ✅ Reduced buyer fraud risk by over **90%**
- 📈 Increased repeat trades from verified suppliers by **2.3x**
- 🌍 Built a global-ready network for **real-time exports** without intermediaries

## What’s Next

We’re now integrating this supplier network with **live pricing tools**, **smart contracts**, and **AI-powered trade forecasts** to create the most advanced agro trading infrastructure in India.
